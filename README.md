- 👋 Hi, I’m Charlie.
- 👀 I’m interested in applying racial equity awareness to data visualizations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, Tableau, R, PostgreSQL/pgAdmin, API interactions and front-end web visualization (geomapping, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on visualizations used to showcase impacts and create forecasts about decisions made to historically underrepresented and underserved communities.
